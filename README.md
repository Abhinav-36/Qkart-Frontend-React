## About the Project 🚀✨

Welcome to **Qkart Shopping Website**! 🎉 This project is a robust **MERN stack e-commerce platform** designed to provide a seamless and intuitive online shopping experience for users, alongside an efficient product management system for administrators. 👩‍💻👨‍💼

It's packed with essential e-commerce features:
* **User Authentication & Authorization** 🔑: Secure login, registration, and role-based access.
* **Dynamic Product Catalog** 📦: Browse a wide range of products with detailed information.
* **Intuitive Shopping Cart** 🛒: Easily add, update, and manage items before checkout.
* **Secure Checkout Process** 🔒: A smooth and secure way to complete purchases.
* **[Add any other key features, e.g., Search & Filters, Product Reviews]**

My motivation for building Qkart was to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development, particularly focusing on creating a scalable and user-friendly e-commerce application using modern web technologies. 🎯

### Built With

* **Frontend:** React.js ⚛️
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js 🟩
* **Database:** MongoDB 🍃
* **Other key technologies:**
    * CSS3 & HTML5
    * React Router (for navigation)
    * JWT (JSON Web Tokens for authentication)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
* MongoDB (You can either install it locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
2.  **Setup file for IP:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```
3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../ # Go back to the root directory
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

5.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add the following:

    ```
    PORT=5000 # Or your preferred port
    MONGO_URI=[Your MongoDB connection string, e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/qkart_db or your Atlas URI]
    JWT_SECRET=[A strong, random string for JWT secret - GENERATE A NEW ONE!]
    # Example: JWT_SECRET=supersecretkeythatshouldbemadeverylongandrandom
    ```
    *If your frontend (e.g., Create React App) requires environment variables to access the backend, you might need a `.env` file in the root directory (or `src` depending on setup) for `REACT_APP_API_URL` or similar.*
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```

## Usage

To run the project locally for development:

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `backend/` directory:
    ```bash
    npm start # or node index.js
    ```
    You should see a message indicating the backend server is running, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    From the root directory of the project:
    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    This will usually open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

The Qkart Shopping Website application should now be running! You can interact with the frontend, and it will communicate with your local backend server.
